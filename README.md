# BotGuys
SD&D project turned RCOS project.

Original bot worked on by Jesse Diaz, Sam Cashman, Pierson Garcia, Michael Pan, and Matthews DeJesus.

Our discord bot, Lantern, will be able to play various card games.
Can play:
- Blackjack
- Poker
- Uno

# For Users:
The invite link for Lantern is [here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1146514624288673992&scope=bot&permissions=378024691776). Please enjoy, and reach out if you have any issues.

# For Developers:
We have included a `requirements.txt` file of all necessary libraries in order to make your own bot based off of Lantern. You will also need to create a folder called `logs` in the root, as well as a `bot_token.txt` and `guild_id.txt` in the `configs` folder to hold your bot token and guild id respecitvely.
